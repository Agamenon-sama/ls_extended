ls with coloring and icons

To use this program, one **needs** to have the `Nerd Fonts` installed since it utilizes those fonts for the icons.

I recommend the *Mononoki Nerd font* for the characters, and *Overpass Mono Nerd font* for the icons if possible
(although most terminals don't permit use of separate fonts for Non-ASCII characters).
